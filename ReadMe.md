Execute the following line to execute the nonogram.
$ python3.4 nonogram/nonogram.py
Note that I used python3.4 on OS X.
The implementation gets the input as stdin.
Also, the cnf folder should be contained in ../ path.

So, you can additionally CWD format as stdin.

e.g.
$ python3.4 nonogram/nonogram.py <Enter>
